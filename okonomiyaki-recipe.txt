Ingredients of Okonomiyaki:
	about 1/2 a large cabbage
	2 cups flour (I use self-raising, my mother says plain flour)
	2 2/3 cups water
	4 eggs
	2 tsp dashi powder (can be replaced by chicken stock powder)
	Okonomi Sauce or Tonkatsu Sauce
	About 6-8 short-cut bacon rashers (Thinly sliced pork is better but it's a little difficult to get in Australian supermarkets)
	1 Tbsp beni-shouga (pickled ginger) chopped finely
	1 large negi (shallots/scallions/spring onions) sliced thinly, 
	Japanese Mayonnaise
	10g Katsuo-bushi
	Ao-nori
	Oil

Finely slice cabbage.  (After slicing, bruising it by squeezing in your hands also helps soften it)
Mix flour, water, eggs in a large mixing bowl.  Mix in dashi, pickled ginger and some negi.  Add cabbage and combine well. 
Heat a little oil in a frypan.  Spoon Cabbage into the frypan, to make a circle about 22cm(9in) across and 1.5cm(3/4in) thick.  Make sure there's enough batter to hold it together.  Neaten the edges by using a spatula to push in the edges and any cabbage or batter that's sticking out.
Place thinly sliced pork on top (or bacon).  
Cook over med-low heat about 5 min.  Flip, then cook another 3-5 min.  When cooked through, turn onto a plate, meat side UP.
Spread sauce generously on top.  Decorate with Mayonnaise, Katsuobushi and Ao-nori.
